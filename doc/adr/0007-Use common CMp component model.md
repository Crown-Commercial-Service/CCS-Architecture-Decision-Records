# 7. Use common CMp component model

Date: 2018-07-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have a number of frameworks being delivered in a series of separate but closely related projects:

Initial marketing activities will be strongly focused on particular buyer segments - for instance with the education sector.

We will use a number of partners to help build these frameworks, but CCS will be the final owners and operators. The frameworks will be built at pace, but will need to share many elements of data, user experience, and logic in order to meet CCS strategy and be deliverable in time at an acceptable level of quality.

## Decision

As defined below, in line with technology strategy, common CMP components will be built and/or used:

- store Agreement data including service offering and supplier interests in a common API
- use common repository for agreement definitions as part of the build process
- use CCS ID for buyer registration and authentication
- use SRS for supplier registration and authentication
- use common API for Party (Buyer and Supplier) details
- synchronise data to and from SalesForce as needed
- all services will be built and integrated together
- use sector specific (initially education) services for needs that are common across agreements
- share common services wherever practicable
- use a common store for questions and answer tasks for framework buyer needs 
- use the same languages and frameworks wherever practicable

## Consequences

- different services need to share services and data
